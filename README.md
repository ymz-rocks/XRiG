# XRiG

This project provides a fresh graphical interface, which assist users to create passwords / hash keys / etc.

XRiG may actually replace the textual-styled passwords with a colored matrix that the user can edit. 
Without the need to fill-in textual passwords using the keyboard, handling complex passwords is now an easier task - especially over smart-devices
The XRiG libarary is developed with js (at the moment)


### Why?

1. The keyboard is not always a comfort solution
2. Textual passwords must be long and complex
3. It is easier to memorize a simple graphical matrix over a complex set of chars


### Where to use?

Authentication systems... mainly. If you got any other ideas for use-cases, please share :)


### Support

FireFox, Chrome, Safari, IE (9 and above), Edge
